# Magahi

This repository contains all the data, tools, applications and publications related to Magahi, an Indo-Aryan language spoken by approx. 11 million speakers largely in the Eastern Indian state of Bihar. Currently 'data' contains both Part-of-Speech annotated (in the directory called 'annotated') as well as raw data (in the directory called 'raw'). The annotated data contains gold data (i.e. manually annotated data) in the directory 'auto-pos' as well as automatically annotated data using the Magahi part-of-speech tagger (available at http://www.kmiagra.org/magahi-pos) in the directory called 'gold-pos'. Additionally an online search engine is also available at http://www.kmiagra.org/msearchit for searching through the raw corpus.

All these resources, tools and data have been developed as part of the research done by Mr. Deepak Alok, Dr. Bornini Lahiri and Dr. Ritesh Kumar under an unfunded project called 'Automatic Language Understanding and Processing Resources for Magahi (ALUP â€“ M)'.

These are being made available for further research and expansion at no cost. However, if you are interested in making a commercial usage of these resources, please contact the creators of this project.
