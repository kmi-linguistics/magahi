# Magahi

This repository contains all the data, tools, applications and publications related to Magahi, an Indo-Aryan language spoken by approx. 11 million speakers largely in the Eastern Indian state of Bihar.

All these resources, tools and data have been developed as part of the research done by Mr. Deepak Alok, Dr. Bornini Lahiri and Dr. Ritesh Kumar under an unfunded project called 'Automatic Language Understanding and Processing Resources for Magahi (ALUP â€“ M)'.

These are being made available for further research and expansion at no cost. However, if you are interested in making a commercial usage of these resources, please contact the creators of this project.
